Set Up API Credentials:

Place the downloaded JSON API credentials file in the same directory as the script and rename it to credentials.json.

Edit Configuration:

Open the script file compare_spreadsheets.py in a text editor and update the SPREADSHEET_ID_1 and SPREADSHEET_ID_2 variables with the IDs of the two spreadsheets you want to compare.

Run the Script:

Run the script using the following command:

sh
Copy code
python compare_spreadsheets.py
Review the Output:

The script will compare the two spreadsheets and provide an output that highlights the differences between them. The differences include added, removed, and modified rows in each sheet.

Output
